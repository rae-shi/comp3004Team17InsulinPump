### Purpose:

This was the final project for COMP 3004, where we were asked to make an insulin pump simulation. Our program simulates the t:slim x2 insulin pump, with basal and bolus insulin delivery, which the admin can configure to their liking.

### Files included:

InsulinPrump.pro  
insulinpump.cpp  
insulinpump.h  
main.cpp  
mainwindow.cpp  
mainwindow.h  
mainwindow.ui  
tests.cpp

### Compilation and Running:

You can access the project in the course VM (VirtualBox) by cloning the repository or moving it into a shared folder (with host and VM) and opening it in QT Creator. You can build it by pressing the hammer icon on the bottom left and running it by pressing the run button on the bottom left.
